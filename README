Welcome to Arch0nte's containment cybersecurity blog !

Here you can read me either explain or complain about cybersecurity topics ranging from CVE to just explaining news in the subject
I'm going to try to keep a rythm of at least one post a week, alterning between one technical post and one about the cybersecurity world in general, enjoyable (opefully !) no matter your technical level !

I hope you'll enjoy your stay here :) I'm completely open to every return I can get so don't hesitate if you have suggestions or questions.
